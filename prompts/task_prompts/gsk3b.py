Condition:    
Design a molecule that achieves high predicted binding affinity to the GSK3B target.

IMPORTANT:
- GSK3B activity is evaluated by a predictive ML model trained on bioactivity data.
- Your goal is to maximize the predicted binding probability (score between 0 and 1).

You are provided with:
- Top-5 example molecules with high GSK3B activity, listed below. Use these for inspiration, but DO NOT COPY them exactly.
- A list of previously generated SMILES, which YOU MUST NOT REPEAT.

Top-5 Example Molecules (SMILES, score):

You must return your response in the following json format.
The text inside each key explains what kind of answer is expected — it is a **guideline, not the answer**.

DO NOT repeat the example text or instructions.  
Instead, write your own scientifically reasoned content based on the task.

Use the following format.
Take a deep breath and think carefully before writing your answer.
