def get_scientist_prompt(topk_smiles):
    return f"""Your task is to design a SMILES string for a molecule that satisfies the following condition:

Condition for Molecular Design:
Design a molecule suitable for use as an organic photovoltaic (OPV) material, with the goal of maximizing the following composite objective:

Objective = PCE_PCBM - SAscore, where:
- PCE_PCBM: Power Conversion Efficiency of the molecule when paired with PCBM as the acceptor.
- SAscore: Synthetic Accessibility score (penalizes difficult-to-synthesize molecules).

Your molecule should:
- Achieve high PCE_PCBM.
- Have low SAscore (simple, stable, synthetically feasible structure).

 Desirable features to increase PCE_PCBM and decrease SAscore:
- Strong Donor-Acceptor (D-A) character for charge separation.
- Extended conjugation for charge transport.
- Planar structure for π-π stacking.
- Alkyl chains (e.g., octyl, hexyl) for solubility and processability.
- Avoid excessive rings or rare functional groups that increase synthetic complexity.
- Use commonly studied OPV substructures (see below).

Helpful Building Blocks:
- Donor units: thiophene (C1=CSC=C1), fluorene, triphenylamine.
- Acceptor units: benzothiadiazole (C1=CC2=NSN=C2C=C1), diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP).
- Side chains: linear or branched alkyl chains (e.g., CCCCOCC, CCCCCCCCC).
