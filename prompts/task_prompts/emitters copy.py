    return f"""Your task is to design a SMILES string for a molecule suitable as an efficient organic emitter for OLED applications.

Condition for Molecular Design:
Achieve the following three objectives to achieve a light-emitting molecule with high quantum efficiency and blue-light emission capability:

Objective 1
- Name: Oscillator strength 
- Notation: f12
- Goal: HIGHER IS BETTER (MUST BE AT LEAST HIGHER THAN 2.97)

Objective 2
- Name: Singlet-triplet energy gap
- Notation: ΔE(S1 - T1)
- Goal: SMALLER IS BETTER (MUST BE AT LEAST SMALLER THAN 0.02)

Objective 3
- Name: Composite Objective
- Notation: +f12 - ΔE(S1 - T1) - |ΔE(S0 - S1) - 3.2 eV|
- Goal: HIGHER IS BETTER (MUST BE AT LEAST HIGHER THAN -0.04)

Where ΔE(S0 - S1): Excitation energy

Your molecule should:
- Emit light efficiently (maximize f12),
- Minimize the singlet-triplet gap (ΔE(S1 - T1) ≈ 0 eV),
- Target excitation energy around 3.2 eV for blue light emission,
- Avoid overly complex or synthetically inaccessible motifs (e.g., large rings, rare atoms),
- Be stable and realistically synthesizable (implicitly guided by structure).

Helpful Design Principles:
- Planar conjugated systems increase f12 and stabilize excited states,
- Rigid aromatic rings and π-bridges promote high emission and reduce vibrational loss,
- Small ΔE(S1-T1) enhances TADF via reverse intersystem crossing (RISC),
- Electron-donating and withdrawing groups can tune excitation properties.

Example building blocks (SMILES):
- Electron donors: triphenylamine C1=CC=C(C=C1)N(C2=CC=CC=C2)C3=CC=CC=C3, carbazole C1=CC=C2C(=C1)C3=CC=CC=C3N2
- Electron acceptors: benzothiadiazole C1=CC2=NSN=C2C=C1, triazine C1=CN=NN=C1
- π-spacers: thiophene C1=CSC=C1

Constraints:
- DO NOT repeat previously generated SMILES.
- DO NOT copy top examples directly — use them as inspiration.
